## About

This app was born from the idea of facilitating the task of the moderator in the [Mafia game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)).
It automatically chooses the roles of the players who play and allows the moderator and the players to know who is still alive, the data is displayed in real time.

More features are planned to be added in the future.
